How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	help focuse only on the diffrences between the files and therefor reduced the amount of code to review drasticly   

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	it could help see the progresion of the project and review mistakes that you made and how you fixed them. It could also give you the freedom to try new things with the safty that you can return to the status quo. 


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	the pros of automatic saves is that their is a small chance that you will make to many changes between saves the cons are that you maybe hard to go back to a specific version of code since it is only saved by time and date and doesn't have a meaniful name the con of saving manualy is that you need to remember to save at every change with can get tedious the pro is that you can give your saves meaningfull names so you know at what state the save is at 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   in projects it could be vital that diffrenth files are saved at the same commit since one may use other files to work, while documents usualy don't rely on other files 


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    don't know I havn't used git yet

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you can be confident that you can go back to the state before you made those changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    android development
