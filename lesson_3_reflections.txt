When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you are working on a project from different locations, either you move from place to place without the same pc or people indifferent locations
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  you might want to manually pull changes rather then do it automatically because you may be working on a file in the repository, if the pull happens before you commit and push and then all your work will be deleted.
